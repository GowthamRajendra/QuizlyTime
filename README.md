## How to setup with Docker
1. Pull the main branch
2. create an atlas mongodb cluster. [How to Set Up a Cloud Database (MongoDB Atlas)](#how-to-set-up-cloud-database-mongodb-atlas)
3. create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and do the following:
    - create a `DB_URI` env variable with a URI to your mongodb cluster
    - create a `JWT_SECRET` env variable with a string. This will be used to generate JWTs so create a secure secret (You could use a uuid creation library).
4. Download and open Docker Desktop, if you don't already have it.
5. In your terminal of choice while in the root directory of the project run the following commands:<br>
```
docker-compose build
```
```
docker-compose up
```
5. The frontend and backend should be up and running. The frontend will be accessible on http://localhost:5173

## How to setup without Docker
1. Pull the main branch
2. create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and do the following:
    - create a `DB_URI` env variable with a URI to your mongodb cluster
    - create a `JWT_SECRET` env variable with a string. This will be used to generate JWTs so create a secure secret (You could use a uuid creation library).
3. cd into the root directory of the project
4. Create a python virtual environment in the root directory of the project by running the following:
```
python -m venv .venv
```
5. Activate the venv
    - (On windows):
        ```
        .venv\Scripts\Activate
        ```
    - (Linux/Mac):
        ```
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
6. Run this command to install the requirements
```    
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
7. Navigate to the frontend directory
```
cd views
```
8. Install node packages (You will need to install node.js to do this if you don't already have it)
```
npm i 
```
9. Start the front end
```
npm run dev
```
10. Open a second terminal
11. cd into the root directory of the project (where app.py is)
12. Run the server with this command 
```
python app.py
```
13. Both the frontend and backend should now be running. The frontend will be accessible on http://localhost:5173

## How to set up cloud database (MongoDB Atlas)

## MVC Architecture
- Models (./models):
    - User model: Schema for how user documents are structured.
    - Question model: Schema for how quiz question documents are structured.
    - Quiz model: Schema for how quiz documents are structured.
- Views (./views/pages):
    - Home: default landing page for the app.   
    - Login: handles login inputs and sends requests to user_controller.py endpoints.
    - Register: handles registration inputs and sends requests to user_controller.py endpoints.
    - Profile: displays user game history, created quizzes and statistics. Sends requests to user_controller.py endpoints.
    - ChooseQuizType: page to choose to play either randomly created quizzes or user create quizzes.
    - Random Quiz Pages:
        - QuizSetup: handles settings selection for playing random quiz. Sends requests to quiz_controller.py
